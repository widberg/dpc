# DPC

Tar analogous utility to work with the BigFile format from Asobo Studio games.

<sup>This repository is a relative of the main [FMTK repository](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk).</sup>

While the tool is named DPC it works with BigFiles from other platforms too.

## Supported Games/Versions

All versions listed have full support. The bold versions are the version that the respective game is equipped to load. Unstable games are games that may be processed by the tool using the `--unsafe` option but do not have a dedicated DPC backend.

* Ratatouille (unstable)
* WALL-E (unstable)
* FUEL
  * **v1.381.67.09 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology**
  * v1.381.66.09 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
  * v1.381.65.09 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
  * v1.381.64.09 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
  * v1.379.60.09 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
  * v1.325.50.07 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
  * v1.220.50.07 - Asobo Studio - Internal Cross Technology
* Up (unstable)
* Toy Story 3 (unstable)

## Tutorial

Since most people being pointed towards this tool don't even know how to run a command line utility, here is a quick rundown for the uninitiated.
First, download the dpc program from the [releases tab](https://github.com/widberg/dpc/releases) of this repository. Download the latest file matching your operating system. Once downloaded, unzip it with 7-zip or a similar utility.
Once it is unzipped, [open a command prompt](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-from-right-click-menu) in the folder you unzipped it to. If you have never used a command line tool before, please read [How to Use the Command Line](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk/wiki/How-to-Use-the-Command-Line).
Now we can begin using the tool.

### Extract/Create BigFiles

To extract a BigFile run the command
```sh
dpc -g fuel -eulf -i "path/to/BIGFILE.DPC" -o "path/to/BIGFILE.DPC.d"
```
where `path/to/BIGFILE.DPC` is the path of the bigfile on disk. This will create a directory `path/to/BIGFILE.DPC.d` next to the BigFile you extracted containing the extracted data.

When you are done messing around with the extracted data you may want to turn it back into a BigFile. This can be done with the command.
```sh
dpc -g fuel -culf -i "path/to/BIGFILE.DPC.d" -o "path/to/NEW_BIGFILE.DPC"
```
where `path/to/BIGFILE.DPC.d` is the path of the extracted folder on disk. This will create a BigFile `path/to/NEW_BIGFILE.DPC` next to the extracted folder.

Note that while the command contains the name of the game FUEL, these commands will work with the other "unstable" games. This is because the formats are similar enough between these games that we can piggyback off the FUEL support even if each individual game has not been considered.

### Extract/Create Objects

Once the BigFile is extracted you may want to modify the objects inside of it. Modifying them with a hex editor may change the size information so it is best to use the dpc tool's capabilities to ensure that valid objects are created. Since the object formats vary much more than the BigFile format does between versions, this is only recommended for stable games.

To extract an object run the command
```sh
dpc fmt -g fuel -e -i path/to/object.UserDefine_Z -o path/to/object.UserDefine_Z.d
```
where `path/to/object.UserDefine_Z` is the path of the object on disk. This will create a directory `path/to/object.UserDefine_Z.d` next to the object you extracted containing the extracted data. In the case of `UserDefine_Z` this directory will contain a `data.txt` file with the contents of the `UserDefine_Z`. This text file can be safely modified.

When you are done messing around with the extracted data you may want to turn it back into an object. This can be done with the command.
```sh
dpc fmt -g fuel -c -i path/to/object.UserDefine_Z.d -o path/to/new_object.UserDefine_Z
```
where `path/to/object.UserDefine_Z.d` is the path of the extracted folder on disk. This will create an object `path/to/new_object.UserDefine_Z` next to the extracted folder.

### Final Note

This tutorial covers the most basic use case that 90% of people want this tool for; in actuality, the tool is far more powerful. To learn about the other options and subcommand, run the command `dpc --help` for more information.
